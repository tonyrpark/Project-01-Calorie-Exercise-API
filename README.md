## API 1 Elements - Food API

- Uses USDA Food API by ajax GET request. User can type in food, click food search, and calories will automatically be inputted
- Retains history through localStorage
- Huge database
- Calories can be manually entered or modified

## API 2 - Quote API

- Originally not the intended API
- Simple API that pulls a motivational quote every day
- Once solid exercise api is on the market or built, site can reach Fully Functional vice MVP

### Unique Code Elements

- The localStorage function was heavily modified in the app.js by utilizing the Bootstrap Framework.
- Use of unique ids and classes in index.html allowed for easy addition of buttons and functions
- Script.js includes both APIs, future advancement can easily be incorporated here
- Style.css uses many different elements learned in class - Bootstrap (jumbotron), Bootstrap Grid; Google Fonts, FontAwesome

##### Branches

- main
- Back-End
- Front-End
- Research
- Staging

###### Lessons Learned

- Best Exercise APIs on the market use frameworks more advanced than AJAX. Nutrionix API is currently one of the better Exercise APIs but unable to implement the v2.0 documentation to our code at this time.
- Git branches and conflicts need to be resolved in order to allow smooth work flow
- Solid original gameplan led to collaborative nature in project
